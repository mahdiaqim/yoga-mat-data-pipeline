# Webscraping yoga mats
## Summary:
### The project has the scripts for webscraping yoga mats from Lululemon and Amazon. it uses multithreading for Amazon. in both cases it has two parts, the first one collects urls for each product and the second collects the targeted features: price, color, reviews, rating , material and images. 
## Motivation:
### A year ago I started practicing yoga. For buying a yoaga mat I have dicovered there are many makes all offering different specifications and my quest is to find the perfect yoga mat. I will collect data to compare every detail of the specifications, the range of prices, the level of care an the ratings to help me make my final decision
## Elements necessary:
### Libraries for webscraping : selenium, urlib.request, pathlib, tempfile
### Libraries to upload images to S3 bucket  : boto3
### Libraries to upload to database created in RDS : psycopg, sqlachemy , pandas and json
### Libraries for multuthreading : ThreadPoolExecutor and wait from concurrent.futures  
## Results:
### In the case of amazon the scraper file contains all functions that are used in the script files. Amazon contains multithreading and it appends continuosly any data scraped to a csv and a json file simultaneously. It collected data for 1000 yoga mats in 5221 seconds.
### In the case of Lululemon multithreading there is only one file that contains all functions, it  uploads continuosly the images to a bucket in s3. At the end it saves all scraped data to a csv file, to a json file and a database in Amazon RDS
